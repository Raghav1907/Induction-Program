# Induction-Program 2k25

# My Day 1 @ GNDEC 
My first day of Induction program started by seeking the blessings of almighty in the morning time by doing the shabad kirtan at gurudwara sahib present inside the college campus where maximum students of CSE and IT 
were present. After completing the shabad kirtan we went to the auditorium where i saw the stage was decorated beautifully. After some time, Our Respected Principal Sir came to the stage and gave a welcome speech
and gave us blessings for starting our career with Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College.

After that Our Chief Guest gave us speech about the life lessons and told us about to be happy for what we get and also thank god for where we are present.

Next, we were taken to our departments (IT) for lab and classroom tour. In the end, we were taken to the Seminar Hall where Our HOD Mr. K S Mann Sir gave us a motivational speech
